1. You need to re-implement the problem of Huffman coding, this time using heap.

2. Unlike the online, your output will be the actual binary code assigned to each character. To generate the codes you need to save the characters in a complete binary tree. Then the codes can be generated by traversing the tree.

4. (Optional and bonus) print the tree.
